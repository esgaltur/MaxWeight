# MaxWeight

## Description
Program for generating the number of exercises and weights based on the Professor Yuri Verkhoshansky program.

## Features
- Calculates weight percentages for bench press based on your maximum weight
- Generates a complete training program for 1-6 weeks
- Displays exercises for each day with weight and repetition counts
- Web interface with Thymeleaf and Bootstrap for a modern user experience
- RESTful API for programmatic access to training program data
- Uses Undertow as the embedded web server for improved performance and scalability
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- Robust error handling with descriptive error messages

## Code Structure
The application has been refactored to use modern software engineering techniques and design patterns:

### Design Patterns
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: Separates the application into three main components:
  - **Model**: Represents the data and business logic (`Week`, `Day`, `Exercise`, `TrainingProgram`)
  - **View**: Handles the display of data (Thymeleaf templates and `ProgramView` for console)
  - **Controller**: Manages user input and coordinates the model and view (`WebController`, `ApiController`, `ProgramController`)
- **Factory Pattern**: Used to create training programs (`ProgramFactory`)
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different display strategies for different types of weeks
- **Dependency Injection**: Spring's IoC container manages dependencies between components
- **REST**: RESTful API design for programmatic access to training program data

### Modulith Architecture
The application has been restructured to follow the modulith architecture principles. A modulith is a modular monolith, where the application is structured into well-defined modules with clear boundaries, but still deployed as a single unit.

#### Modules

The application is structured into the following modules:

##### Core Module (`cz.esgaltur.maxweight.core`)

Contains the domain model classes that represent the core business entities:

- `Day`: Enum representing training days (DAY1, DAY2)
- `Week`: Enum representing training weeks (WEEK1-WEEK6)
- `Exercise`: Represents a single exercise with weight percentage, actual weight, and repetition count
- `TrainingProgram`: Represents a complete training program for a specific week

This module has no dependencies on other modules and is kept free of external dependencies to maintain a clean domain model.

##### Program Module (`cz.esgaltur.maxweight.program`)

Contains services for creating and managing training programs:

- `ProgramDataService`: Provides weight percentages and repetition counts for each week and day
- `ProgramFactory`: Creates training programs using the data from ProgramDataService

Dependencies:
- Core module: Uses the domain model classes from the core module

This module encapsulates the business logic for generating training programs and does not depend on web or presentation concerns.

##### Web Module (`cz.esgaltur.maxweight.web`)

Contains controllers for the web interface and REST API:

- `WebController`: Handles requests for the web interface and returns Thymeleaf views
- `ApiController`: Provides a REST API for accessing training program data programmatically

Dependencies:
- Core module: Uses the domain model classes from the core module
- Program module: Uses the services from the program module to generate training programs

This module is responsible for the presentation layer of the application and does not contain business logic.

#### Event-Based Communication

The application uses Spring's event system to enable communication between modules without direct dependencies. This is a key aspect of the modulith architecture, allowing for loose coupling between modules.

Events are used in the following scenarios:

1. **Program Creation**: When a new training program is created in the `program` module, a `TrainingProgramCreatedEvent` is published. This event can be consumed by any other module that needs to react to program creation.

The event-based communication is implemented as follows:

- **Event Classes**: Domain events are defined in the `core` module (e.g., `TrainingProgramCreatedEvent`).
- **Event Publishing**: Services in the `program` module publish events using Spring's `ApplicationEventPublisher`.
- **Event Listeners**: Components in other modules can listen for events using the `@EventListener` annotation.

This approach has several benefits:
- Modules can communicate without direct dependencies
- New functionality can be added by creating new event listeners without modifying existing code
- The system becomes more extensible and maintainable

#### Benefits of the Modulith Architecture

1. **Clear Module Boundaries**: Each module has a well-defined responsibility and clear boundaries.
2. **Reduced Coupling**: Modules depend only on what they need, reducing coupling between different parts of the application.
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to one module are less likely to affect other modules.
4. **Better Testability**: Modules can be tested in isolation, making tests more focused and reliable.
5. **Easier to Understand**: The application structure is more intuitive, making it easier for developers to understand and work with the codebase.
6. **Evolutionary Path to Microservices**: If needed in the future, modules can be extracted into separate microservices with minimal changes.
7. **Event-Based Communication**: Modules can communicate through events without direct dependencies.

#### Implementation Details

The modulith architecture is implemented using standard Java packages and Spring's component scanning. The main application class (`MaxWeightApplication`) uses component scanning to discover and register beans from each module:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@ComponentScan(basePackages = {
    "cz.esgaltur.maxweight.core",
    "cz.esgaltur.maxweight.program",
    "cz.esgaltur.maxweight.web",
    "cz.esgaltur.maxweight.config"
})
public class MaxWeightApplication {
    // ...
}
```

Each module has a `package-info.java` file that documents the module's purpose, responsibilities, and dependencies.

## Building the Project
This project uses Maven for build management. To build the project:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This will create a JAR file in the `target` directory.

## Running the Application

### Console Application
To run the original console application:

```bash
java -jar target/maxweight-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

### Web Application
To run the Spring Boot web application:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Then open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

## Using the REST API

### Get a single training program

```
GET /api/program/{weekNumber}?maxWeight=X
```

- `weekNumber`: The week number (1-6)
- `maxWeight`: Your maximum bench press weight

### Get multiple training programs

```
GET /api/programs?fromWeek=X&toWeek=Y&maxWeight=Z
```

- `fromWeek`: The starting week number (1-6)
- `toWeek`: The ending week number (1-6)
- `maxWeight`: Your maximum bench press weight
